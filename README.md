# Last-Mile-optimzation-using-Machine-Learning
Efficient last-mile delivery is a critical component of modern logistics, directly impacting customer satisfaction and operational costs. This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to optimize last-mile delivery times using a dataset from Delhivery, a leading delivery partner in Pan India. By analyzing various factors such as route details, distances, and timing information, we sought to identify the key drivers of delivery efficiency. We employed three different machine learning models—Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Naive Bayes—to predict delivery times based on these factors. The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed, followed by a correlation analysis to select the most relevant features. The models were then trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Our findings reveal that Random Forest and GBM models significantly outperformed Naive Bayes, with lower error margins and higher predictive accuracy. These results highlight the importance of choosing robust, flexible models for complex logistics data. The insights gained from this study provide valuable guidance for optimizing last-mile delivery processes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of logistics operations.
